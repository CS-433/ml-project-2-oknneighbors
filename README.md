# Protein Fitness Prediction - ML4Science - EPFL 2023

Welcome to our ML4science project in collaboration with the Laboratory of the Physics and Biological Systems. The aim of this project is to predict the amino acid sequence of a protein based on a desired fitness value.

This project is built upon the paper 'Learning protein fitness models from evolutionary and assay-labeled' and its corresponding GitHub repository 'combining-evolutionary-and-assay-labelled-data'.
